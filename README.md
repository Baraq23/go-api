# Event Management API Project

This project is a backend API designed to handle event creation and user bookings efficiently. Built using Go with the Gin web framework, it leverages SQLite as the database, with GORM as the ORM for smooth and reliable database interactions. The API provides a solid foundation for managing events, enabling features such as event listing, creation, and user reservations.
